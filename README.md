Abstract:
This is a self-directed open source project made solely for the purpose of educating and arming the populace with the tools to fight against the ever-present threat of misinformation. Starting in July 2022, the idea was to create a space that combined a fact-checking tool with an informative guide to avoid or detect fake news. The website's search feature scours the internet for the latest authentic stories on the topic in question using NewsAPI and returns these, whereas the soon to be available original fact-checker will use machine learning to identify fake news by ranking on a scale. It will use characteristics of a piece of text or news such as grammar, language, sentiment and source, and will learn from examples of fake and reliable news to assign ratings for authenticity.
